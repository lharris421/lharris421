## Hi, weclome to my github site!

<- If you couldn't guess, this is me! When I am not working, I enjoy getting out to trails either running, hiking, or backpacking. 

Iâ€™m currently working on my dissertation on confidence intervals for penalized regression models.

I love learning new things and am currently reading too many books/manuscripts at once. Recently, I've been familiarizing myself with causual inference, precision medicine, and statistical ecology.

I am also working on an R package called `indexr` (pinned). It is currently in progress, but the intention is to make the management of a large number of simulation files (or results) less of a nusance so that the focus can be put on the research itself. If it sounds like something you are interested it, take a look and give me feedback!!

For more information about my work see my personal site: https://lharris421.github.io (in progress)
