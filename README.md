## Hi, weclome to my github site!

When I am not working, I enjoy getting out to trails either running, hiking, or backpacking. 

I’m currently working on my dissertation on high-dimensional intervals for penalized regression.

I love learning new things and am currently reading too many books/manuscripts at once. Recently, I've been familiarizing myself with causual inference, precision medicine, and statistical ecology.

For more information about my work see my personal site: https://lharris421.github.io (in progress)
